# I had to play "Petit papa NoÃ«l" in an original way for some events. So, why
# not using these cool electrodes to handle it ? Left hand would control the
# volume and right hand, the note which is played.
#
# Disclaimer : Even with a lot of practice, I'm not sure you will be able to
# play a nice with this script :)
#
# As all the other scripts in this repository, I release it under a very
# permissive license. To make a long story short : do whatever you want with
# this script (but try to have fun :), I don't mind. It would be cool to quote
# the origin of the script if you reuse it, but you don't have to. I'd like to
# be noticed of what you did cool with it (if you think it's worth). :)
# Ah, I almost forgot : If by chance we ever meet and you think this script is
# worth, you can buy me a soda :)
